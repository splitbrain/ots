# Open Text Summarizer Web Interface

This is a simple web interface for the [Open Text Summarizer](https://github.com/neopunisher/Open-Text-Summarizer) library.

It's a single PHP file. I wrote this decades ago. It's not the best style but it works.

This repo dockerizes the whole setup, because OTS is no longer in Debian.

Nowadays, there are better summarizers out there, so this is mostly here because I hate to drop old projects.
